            The initial idea of the web was that it was open to everyone. It was free of royalties and capitalism and was recognized as a place where information could be spread free of government and corporate control. However the web we use nowadays has shifted. In the “State of the Web 2019” has seen web traffic grow over 50% on the account of mobile traffic. Over half of the world’s population is now on the internet.

            Companies such as Google and Facebook have taken advantage of this trend and used it to capitalize effectively. This has shaped the way we consume news and the way we interact with our friends and family. Google has dominated the industry as the globe’s top search engine to the point where the synonymous word to find something on the internet is, “Google it.” Both companies are heavily involved in lobbying.

            “...in 2015, Google announced it was updating its search engine ranking algorithm to reward sites that were mobile-friendly.” This lead to a rise in competition to improve user experience across all device types. After the rise of the responsive layout, there was a competition to create accelerated content which led to Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages. Content directly lived on each platform’s site, so users would be more inclined to use the platform. Digital colonialism brings the internet to underdigitalized areas of the globe, but at the expense of creativity and entrepreneurial freedom prompting activist groups to push back.

        “Here at Viget, we’re engaged citizens of the web, as designers, developers and as users.”

            All digital users are recognized as important influences on the development of the web. It is important to pay attention to how we consume the internet and social media on a day to day basis because our activity inherently shapes the future of it.

            My own perspective on the involvement of web authors is split between two factions as I am a human consuming the internet but also a person that benefits off of it. I think it struck a chord with me that Viget saw improving usability as a marketing ploy for digital powerhouses like Google and Facebook to increase capital and traffic. On one hand as a UX designer, I would like for underrepresented populations to have access to the internet, so that they have the chance to use it. On the other hand if I plan to make a living off of it and work with said corporations it limits the creative freedom and insteads becomes a game of how to create an experience that makes existing customers stay.

            In the current web world I think there is a serious lack of empathy in society as there used to be since the internet is becoming so immersive and quick. The blur between reality and digital is becoming blurred due to the increase of digital spaces such as the Metaverse and Web3. Society will definitely soon see a rise in nepotism babies from founding leaders in tech and dystopian novels.

            I perceive the web to be lacking in areas such as privacy and security, as personal information is shared without knowledge or consent, lack of regulation and oversight. This leads to the spread of misinformation and harmful content, representation and diversity concerns with a lack of representation in terms of who creates and controls content and technology, and digital divide and lack of digital literacy that limit access to information and opportunities for some communities.
