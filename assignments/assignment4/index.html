        <p class="verse">
            Beneath the boughs and in the field, <br />
            A secret world, so small concealed. <br />
            A world where bunnies, soft and fleet,<br />
            Bound among the grass and wheat. <br />
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Their cotton tails a fluffy sight, <br />
            As they play beneath the light. <br />
            With eyes that gleam like polished stone, <br />
            They hop and dance, and call it home. <br />
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            They nibble on the clover green, <br />
            A sight so pure, a pastoral scene. <br />
            Their little noses twitch and twitch, <br />
            As they forage, without a hitch. <br />
        </p>

        <p class="verse ">
            With fur as soft as angel's wings, <br />
            They hop about, a joy that sings. <br />
            Their gentle grace, a gift to see, <br />
            A wonder in their majesty.<br />
        </p>

        <p class="verse ">
            Oh, rabbits dear, so quick and shy, <br />
            A little world, you occupy. <br />
            Beneath the boughs and in the field, <br />
            A secret world, so small concealed. <br />
