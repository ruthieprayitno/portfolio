            <p class="verse">
                I am Edward, a man of heart,<br />
                Living in the present, playing my part.<br />
                I cherish the moments with loved ones dear,<br />
                Even when life throws me a curve ball here.<br />
            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                I hold on to my vision, through thick and thin,<br />
                Knowing that good deeds lead to reward within.<br />
                I observe and spread kindness in my own way,<br />
                Living with compassion each and every day.<br />
            </p>
            <P class="verse">
                It's not always easy to accept ourselves,<br />
                But with supportive people, we find our strengths and delve.<br />
                We are all blessed, and driven by weakness too,<br />
                Choosing our own path, and making our own truth.<br />
            </P>
            <P class="verse">
                You, my dear, bring peace with your smile,<br />
                And with you, I feel like I'm home after a long mile.<br />
                We've built our own world, and endure everything,<br />
                Growing together, and seeing what the future will bring.<br />
            </P>
            <P class="verse">
                In elementary school, I met people I could never forget,<br />
                Who welcomed me and encouraged me when I was upset.<br />
                Though I wasn't mature enough to show appreciation,<br />
                Reflecting on those moments has given me inspiration.<br />
            </P>
            <P class="verse">
                High school was difficult, but I found people who helped me through,<br />
                Even though it was hard to stay connected with the teachers too.<br />
                It's up to us to seek and accept help,<br />
                And choose to be a part of that life-changing step.<br />
            </P>
            <P class="verse">
                Though there are things I want to accomplish,<br />
                I carry my family's love and every moment cherished.<br />
                They are worth fighting for, and always will be,<br />
                And with an altruistic mindset, I know I can see,<br />
                A lucid light shining bright for my desire,<br />
                Without fear of having my goals stolen, no matter how dire.<br />
                For emotions are our instincts, and they help us survive,<br />
                With an altruistic mindset, our goals come alive.<br />
