        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <h2>of Self</h2>
        
        <p>
            I have learned that people have a common answer to whether or not they want to change their past with the answer being no. There is a thought that if you attract people who have a similar mindset to yourself. Many things, good and bad, have occurred in my life but I remain with the thought that I would not change anything that happened because every moment has affected who I am as a person today. Surrounding myself with people who have a similar mindset to me is not something that I do consciously but I think it is just something that happens.
            I've realized that I lack intimacy in my life due to my upbringing, so I've been trying to find ways to address it. That's why I decided to make poems about the answers I receive from people close to me this time. I think writing can be a powerful tool for deepening my understanding of others and connecting with them on a deeper level. When I write, I have more time to reflect on what I'm hearing and respond thoughtfully, which can lead to more meaningful conversations. Writing also gives me a permanent record of the conversation, which I can revisit later to reinforce what I learned or share with others. Finally, writing can be a form of self-expression that allows me to explore my own thoughts and feelings more deeply. By putting my own thoughts and reactions to what I'm learning into writing, I may gain new insights and perspectives about myself and my relationships.
