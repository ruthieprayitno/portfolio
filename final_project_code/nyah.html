            <p class="verse">
                A small town life was all she knew<br />
                But dreams and ambitions started to brew<br />
                Her grandma's spirit was strong and true<br />
                And soon Nyah knew what she had to do<br />
            </p>
            <P class="verse">
                She packed her bags and left her home<br />
                In search of a life that she could own<br />
                Chicago was where she wanted to roam<br />
                To pursue a career in film, she was grown<br />
            </P>
            <P class="verse">
                Her college years were filled with delight<br />
                Good roommates and memories that were bright<br />
                She found her passion, her creative might<br />
                And knew that this was her guiding light<br />
            </P>
            <P class="verse">
                When asked if she would change a thing<br />
                Nyah replied with a humble ring<br />
                Her experiences both good and bad bring<br />
                Her current morals and thoughts that sing<br />
            </P>
            <P class="verse">
                Moving forward, she'll pave her way<br />
                With her camera, she'll capture each day<br />
                Her dreams and ambitions will never sway<br />
                For Nyah knows she'll make it one day.<br />
            </p>
