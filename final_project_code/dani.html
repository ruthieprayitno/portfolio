        <p class="verse">
            From Mexico to the States I came, <br />
            A Latina with a unique name,<br />
            Raised in a land so far away,<br />
            But here I found my place to stay.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            My dreams were once to teach the young,<br />
            But dance and art soon took the tongue,<br />
            I followed my heart, not others' voices,<br />
            And found a life filled with choices.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            In Chicago, I found a friend,<br />
            Whose talent never seems to end,<br />
            Dani, an artist and dancer too,<br />
            Who makes this city feel brand new.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            With family and friends by my side,<br />
            I found the strength to take my stride,<br />
            To live my life the way I choose,<br />
            And never let others dim my hues.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            With family and friends by my side,<br />
            I found the strength to take my stride,<br />
            To live my life the way I choose,<br />
            And never let others dim my hues.<br />
            I live by a motto that rings true,<br />
            "Everything happens for a reason," too,<br />
            And though I may not always see,<br />
            I trust in fate and destiny.<br />
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            So, if I could go back in time,<br />
            I wouldn't change a thing in my rhyme,<br />
            But observe those moments with a new eye,<br />
            To better understand how and why.<br />     
        </p>
